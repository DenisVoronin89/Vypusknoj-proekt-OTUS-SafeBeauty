      "usage": "These ingredients are typically used as preservatives in a wide range of cosmetics. Though usually not specified as containing formaldehyde, these ingredients release formaldehyde as a result of chemical decomposition. \r\n",
      "explanation": "Formaldehyde is considered a known Group 1 Carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning it causes cancer in humans.\r\n\r\nDMDM Hydantoin is an example of a formaldehyde releaser, which means that the substance can \r\nrelease formaldehyde molecules continuously over time, leading to exposure through inhalation or skin absorption. In addition to it's carcinogenicity, formaldehyde is a harmful allergen that can cause contact dermatitis, and less severe allergic reactions. In most cases, ingredient lists do not indicate any formaldehyde-releasing potential. Other formaldehyde releasers include methenamine, quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, 5-bromo-5-nitro-1,3 dioxane and hydroxymethylglycinate. ",

Your skin may come into contact with 1,4-dioxane when you use cosmetics, detergents, and shampoos containing 1,4-dioxane. During 1992–1997, the average concentration of 1,4-dioxane in some cosmetic products reportedly ranged from 14 to 79 mg/kg. In a more recent survey reported by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, the levels of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetic products were found to be lower (1.5–12 ppm in baby and children’s products and 2–23 ppm in adult products) than in the survey done by the FDA in the 1990s.",

At the same time, Denmark notified the Commission that it had banned propylparaben and butylparaben in cosmetic products for children up to three years of age. In October 2011, the SCCS added a clarification to its previous opinion, concluding that a “risk could not be excluded” for leave-on products for use in the nappy area, for children below the age of six months.\r\nThe SCCS has been asked to consider whether its opinions on the parabens need to be updated.\r\n\r\nhttp://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-102079.html",

      "explanation": "Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate, is an anionic surfactant commonly used in household cleaning products (laundry detergents, spray cleaners, and dishwasher detergents). The concentration of SLS found in consumer products varies, but typically ranges from 0.01% to 50% in cosmetic products and 1% to 30% in cleaning products. SLS can be synthetic or naturally derived.\r\n\r\nContamination with 1,4-dioxane is falsely associated with SLS. 1,4-dioxane has the potential to contaminate some ingredients during the ethoxylation process, like sodium laureth sulfate (also called sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES). Contamination by manufacturing equipment, surfactants that are not ethoxylated, such as SLS, do not share the same risk of 1,4-dioxane contamination. It is important to note, however, that potential for cross-contamination during manufacturing exists. Manufacturers of SLS and products containing SLS can perform chemical analyses to confirm if there are detectable levels of 1,4-dioxane in the SLS ingredient or formulated consumer product.",

It is a mixture of fatty acids and coconut oil which is used in cosmetic products to make them foamy or to keep ingredients from separating. Potential health impacts: People may be exposed to cocamide MEA by skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion. Cocamide MEA vapor may cause lung irritation and asthma. There is no evidence to suggest that cocamide MEA itself is a carcinogen, however MEA may contain trace amounts of diethanolamine, which is categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a possible human carcinogen. http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol101/mono101-004.pdf California Proposition 65 does not list cocamide MEA as a carcinogen or as a reproductive toxin. The Personal Care Products Council, an industry trade group, recommends that cocamide MEA be limited to 10 percent in leave-in products and not be used in products that will be aerosolized. http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm109655.htm\r\n\r\nToxicol Sci.

      "usage": "A combination of nearly 3000 fragrant ingredients is added to most personal care products to mask odours or add a pleasant scent. ",
      "explanation": "Our rating to \"Fragrance\" applies to manufacturers who labelled \"Fragrance\" with no clear company policy on whether they use synthetic or all-natural fragrances. If companies have clear policies on their usage, with a combination of credible organic certifiers, \"Fragrance\" will be the review on a case by case basis. The overall ratings of the individual product might improve pending such review. The major concern with fragrance is that it is not required by law to disclose the individual ingredients used to produce it. Therefore, many fragrance ingredients which are harmful can be omitted from the label. While it is often a mix of synthetic and natural ingredients, fragrance commonly consists of harmful constituents such as phthalates. In US FDA law, 21 CFR 701.3(a) Fragrance and Flavors section. \r\n\r\nFragrance and flavour compounds may be declared in descending order of predominance as \"fragrance\" and \"flavour.\" If a fragrance compound also serves as a flavour, it must be declared as \"flavour and fragrance.\" The components (ingredient) of a fragrance or flavour may also be declared individually by their appropriate label names. The ingredient or mixture of ingredients acting as a masking agent, i.e., covering the undesirable off-odour of a product without adding a discernable odour to it, may be declared by their name(s) or as \"fragrance\" (instead of a better designation). A masking agent present in a product at an insignificant level may be considered an incidental ingredient under § 701.3(1)(2)(iii) in which case it need not be declared on the label.\r\n\r\nFDA does not have the same legal authority to require allergen labeling for cosmetics as for food. So, if you are concerned about fragrance sensitivities, you may want to choose products that are fragrance free, and check the ingredient list carefully. If consumers have questions, they may choose to contact the manufacturer directly.\r\n\r\nAccording to EU Article 19 (1) Regulation No. 1223/2009 (cosmetics regulation), cosmetic products should list their ingredients on the packaging. However, perfume aromatic compositions and their raw materials are referred to as ‘parfum’ or ‘aroma’. Substances for which the cosmetics regulation provides individual labelling are an exception to this terminology. At the moment, 26 fragrance allergens are subject to individual labelling (EU annex III of the cosmetics regulation).\r\n\r\nCanada uses the international naming convention for cosmetics, INCI. Under this naming convention, components of a fragrance can be listed as individual ingredients or can be listed under the term \"parfum\" (in the E.U. and Canada) or \"fragrance\" (in the U.S.).\r\n\r\nWhile some people are only mildly affected by scents, others have severe reactions. Some common symptoms include: headaches, feeling dizzy, feeling tired or weak, shortness of breath, nausea, cold-like symptoms,and worsening asthma symptoms.\r\n",
      "notes": "Our rating to \"Fragrance\" is applicable to manufacturers who labelled \"Fragrance\" with no clear company policy on whether they use synthetic or all-natural fragrances. If companies have clear policies on their usage, with combination of credible organic certifiers, \"Fragrance\" will be review on a case by case basis. The overall ratings of individual product might improve pending such review. The major concern with fragrance is that it is not required by law to disclose the individual ingredients used to produce it. Therefore, many fragrance ingredients which are harmful can be omitted from the label due to the company's trade secret. \r\n\r\nIn fact according to the FDA, Fragrance ingredients in cosmetics must meet the same requirement for safety as other cosmetic ingredients. Thought the he law does not require FDA approval before they go on the market, but they must be safe for consumers when they are used according to labeled directions, or as people customarily use them. Companies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics have a legal responsibility for ensuring that their products are safe and properly labeled.\r\n\r\nEvery Chemical that falls under the Fragrance category might not be carcinogenic.\r\n\r\n1.Fragrance might contain various chemicals but Phthalates are a group of chemicals used in hundreds of products. The phthalate commonly used in fragrance products is diethyl phthalate, or DEP. DEP does not pose known risks for human health as it is currently used in cosmetics and fragrances. In fact in 2002, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel reaffirmed its original conclusion (reached in 1985), finding that DBP, DMP, and DEP were safe as used in cosmetic products. FDA reviewed the safety and toxicity data for phthalates, including the CDC data from 2001, as well as the CIR conclusions based on reviews in 1985 and 2002. Based on this information, FDA determined that there wasn’t a sound, scientific basis to support taking regulatory action against cosmetics containing phthalates.\r\n\r\n2.Although all other ingredients in your lip gloss, body wash and other scented cosmetic products must be disclosed on the label by specific name, the so-called “fragrance loophole” in federal labeling law means that ingredients added to provide a pleasant scent, or to mask a bad one, need only be listed under the generic term “fragrance.” We know only that styrene might be an ingredient in any given fragrance because the International Fragrance Association, an industry trade group, publishes an online “Transparency List” of ingredients that perfumers say they use in formulas for consumer products. Styrene is one of the 3,000-odd ingredients on the list. Moreover it MIGHT also contain other chemicals that are carcinogenic.\r\n\r\nConsidering these facts and since not all the chemicals under fragrance aren't carcinogens, it is only right to say that the cosmetic product that we use might or might not be carcinogenic because of the \"fragrance loophole\". This is exactly why we have justly rated the product as \"POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN\" and not \"PROVEN TO BE CARCINOGEN\".",

It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, i.e., one in which a single hydrogen atom from a group of six atoms from the benzene molecule has been replaced by a univalent group, in this case CH3. As such, its IUPAC systematic name is methylbenzene. Used in nail polishes with Toulene. BTEX is an acronym for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. This group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is found in petroleum hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, and other common environmental contaminants.  ",

      "usage": "Petrolatum is mineral oil jelly (i.e. petroleum jelly). It is used as a barrier to lock moisture in the skin in a variety of moisturizers and also in hair care products to make your hair shine. Some companies called their petroleum jelly, \"Carcinogen-free Pharmaceutical Grade Petroleum Jelly\" or \"surgical grade\". These are more pure than petroleum found in crude oil. Health Canada considers petrolatum non-toxic. European Union put numerous grades of petrolatum on a list of dangerous substances. Only highly refined petrolatum can be used in cosmetics there.

Concerns have been raised that polyacrylamide used in agriculture may contaminate food with acrylamide. While polyacrylamide itself is relatively non-toxic, it is known that commercially available polyacrylamide contains minute residual amounts of acrylamide remaining from its production, usually less than 0.05% w/w. California requires (current as of 2010) products containing acrylamide as an ingredient to be labeled with a statement that it is \"a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.\"",

      "notes": "ACRYLAMIDE HOMOPOLYMER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, polyacrylamide is made up of repeating molecules of acrylamide, and the toxicity properties of the poly version change. A similar example is the case of vinyl chloride (a carcinogen) and polyvinyl chloride.\r\n \r\nIn both of these cases, the basic compound (also called the monomer, if that’s of interest) has serious health concerns, while the polymer does not have health concerns in finished products UNLESS the monomer breaks down. This can happen, and some forms of polyacrylamide are more stable than others and therefore less likely to slough off the bad chemical. I would bet that the labels do not clarify whether the more or less stable version is used. Another concern is that someone has to turn the monomer into a polymer, and those worker exposures are concerning.\r\n \r\nFor Think Dirty, it would be better to score polyacrylamide separately from acrylamide and list acrylamide as a contaminant – it’s more accurate.",
